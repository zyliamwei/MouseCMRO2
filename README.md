The CMRO2 is calculated according to the Fick principle. T2-relaxation-under-spin-tagging (TRUST) and phase-contrast (PC) MRI are utilized to measure the oxygen extration fraction (OEF) and global cerebral blood flow (CBF), respectively. With these two parameters ready, Fick principle is applied to estimate CMRO2. Data processing is divided into three components: (1) analyzing fast-spin-echo (FSE) MRI for brain volume; (2) analyzing TRUST MRI for OEF; and (3) analyzing PC MRI for total blood flow.
